  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>Your Southeast Regional Directorate Team is pleased to present the Employee Idea Board, an innovative, collaborative space designed to facilitate interaction between our team and the Region’s proactive problem-solvers and visionaries.</p>

  <p>Here we invite you to ask yourself, “what do I think we could we do it better, and how?”</p>

  <p>Using this tool you can present your own ideas or engage with the ideas of others. A vote for an idea is not necessarily a vote for its implementation, but a vote for the concept to be presented to the Regional Directorate Team. The ideas with the highest number of votes will float to the top of this page, and once an idea reaches XXX votes, it will be passed to the Regional Directorate Team for review and response.</p>

  <p>To post your idea, first review the Idea Criteria. Your concept may cover a wide range of subjects such as: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Science needs,</li>
      <li>Ways to streamline a process,</li>
      <li>Suggested modifications to a specific policy,</li>
      <li>Training and professional development opportunities,</li>
      <li>Different ways to implement land management techniques,</li>
      <li>Different  ways to implement a policy or other business practices,</li>
      <li>Innovative experiments or partnerships,</li>
      <li>Opportunities for internal and external collaboration,</li>
      <li>And more. </li>
    </ul>

  <p>Be courteous and constructive in your feedback. This is not a place to air your grievances; it’s a place to present your solutions. Please review the Rules of Behavior for further information as misuse of the tool will result in the suspension of your account.</p>

  <h3>Idea Criteria</h3>

  <p>For an Idea to reach the top it must meet these basic criteria:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A clearly stated need, problem, or opportunity,</li>
    <li>A proposed complete or partial solution to the problem, and</li>
    <li>Related materials to support your concept (optional).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For those seeking to articulate a Science Need to Science Applications, consider the following question: “what are your program’s most pressing management issues that could benefit from science information?” Areas to consider include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Biological planning</li>
    <li>Conservation design</li>
    <li>Modeling</li>
    <li>Research-developing and testing hypotheses</li>
    <li>Monitoring and evaluation of monitoring results</li>
    <li>Survey and study design</li>
    <li>Gathering and analyzing data</li>
    <li>Formal quantitative assessments of population status (e.g., fishery stock assessments)</li>
    <li>Synthesis and documentation of information (expert opinion, results of studies, etc.)</li>
    <li>Application/incorporation of synthesized information in decision making</li>
    <li>Communication of information related to above topics to peers and decision makers</li>
    <li>Data/information management (spatial and non-spatial)</li>
    <li>Spatial analysis (statistical and GIS)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Employees and board Moderators are able to pose questions and comments to help refine ideas. Please respond to feedback on your idea in a timely fashion.</p>

  <p>If your idea does not meet these criteria, a Moderator will engage and attempt to assist you in getting it there. If the idea cannot be fully developed, you will be notified before its deletion.</p>
